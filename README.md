# Court File Digitization DAO (CFD-DAO)

## üìÑ Project Overview

The Court File Digitization DAO is a blockchain-powered solution designed to revolutionize court file management through decentralized, transparent, and secure document handling.

### üéØ Core Mission

Empower local courts and legal communities by:
- Streamlining document digitization
- Reducing administrative backlogs
- Ensuring secure and transparent file access
- Providing a decentralized governance mechanism for file management

## üåü Key Features

### 1. Blockchain-Backed File Storage
- Immutable and secure file storage using blockchain technology
- Smart contract-governed access permissions
- Complete audit trail of file interactions

### 2. Decentralized Access Control
- Permissioned voting for file access requests
- Multi-level authorization system
- Granular access type management

### 3. Tokenized Governance
- Community-driven funding for digitization initiatives
- Democratic voting on court digitization priorities
- Incentive mechanisms for data verification and upload

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Contract Modules
1. **Constants**: Global configuration and error codes
2. **Traits**: Contract interfaces and type definitions
3. **Data Model**: Storage structures and mappings
4. **Authentication**: User and admin authorization
5. **File Management**: Core file operation logic
6. **Access Control**: Permission and access tracking
7. **Governance**: Proposal and voting mechanisms

### Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Bitcoin Layer)
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Testing**: Mocha, Chai, Clarinet
- **Development**: TypeScript, Node.js
